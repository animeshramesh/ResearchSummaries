## Learning to Learn: Model Regression Networks for Easy Small Sample Learning

### Author/paper background
* Yu-Xiong Wang - PhD, RI
* ECCV 2016


### Motivation
* Learning techniques for low-shot scenarios.


### Solution 
* Learn a class-agnostic transformation from w0 (classsifer learnt from small set of samples) to w* (classifier learnt from large training set)
* 700 models per category can be simulated.


### Experiments/Evaluation
* Features of AlexNet
* One vs all SVM classifiers for w* and w0.
* Regression network - 4 FC layers + Leaky ReLu
* Caffe implementation.
